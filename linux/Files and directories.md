# Files and Directories

In Linux, managing files and directories is a fundamental skill. This page will guide you through the basic commands and concepts needed to create, manipulate, and navigate files and directories in the Linux file system.

## Understanding Files and Directories

### Files

A file in Linux is a collection of data stored on disk. Files can contain text, binary data, or be executable scripts and programs. Each file is identified by a unique name within its directory.

### Directories

Directories, also known as folders, are special files that can contain other files and directories. They help organize the file system into a hierarchical structure, making it easier to manage and locate files.

## Basic File Operations

### Creating Files

There are several ways to create files in Linux:

- **Using `touch`**: Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

  ```bash
  touch filename.txt
  ```

- **Using `echo`**: Creates a file with content.

  ```bash
  echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
  ```

- **Using `cat`**: Creates a file with content from standard input.

  ```bash
  cat > notes.txt
  This is my note.
  Press Ctrl+D to save.
  ```

### Viewing Files

- **Using `cat`**: Displays the content of a file.

  ```bash
  cat filename.txt
  ```

- **Using `less`**: Allows you to scroll through a file's content.

  ```bash
  less filename.txt
  ```

- **Using `head`**: Displays the first 10 lines of a file.

  ```bash
  head filename.txt
  ```

- **Using `tail`**: Displays the last 10 lines of a file.

  ```bash
  tail filename.txt
  ```

### Copying Files

- **Using `cp`**: Copies a file from one location to another.

  ```bash
  cp source.txt destination.txt
  ```

### Moving and Renaming Files

- **Using `mv`**: Moves a file to a new location or renames it.

  ```bash
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt
  mv file.txt /path/to/destination/
  ```

### Deleting Files

- **Using `rm`**: Removes a file.

  ```bash
  rm filename.txt
  ```

## Basic Directory Operations

### Creating Directories

- **Using `mkdir`**: Creates a new directory.

  ```bash
  mkdir mydirectory
  ```

### Navigating Directories

- **Using `cd`**: Changes the current directory.

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory
  ```

- **Going to Home Directory**:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

- **Moving Up One Directory Level**:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

- **Using `pwd`**: Prints the current working directory.

  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

### Listing Directory Contents

- **Using `ls`**: Lists files and directories.

  ```bash
  ls
  ```

- **Listing with Details**:

  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```

- **Listing Hidden Files**:

  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```

### Copying Directories

- **Using `cp -r`**: Recursively copies a directory and its contents.

  ```bash
  cp -r sourcedir destinationdir
  ```

### Moving Directories

- **Using `mv`**: Moves a directory to a new location.

  ```bash
  mv mydirectory /path/to/destination/
  ```

### Deleting Directories

- **Using `rmdir`**: Removes an empty directory.

  ```bash
  rmdir emptydir
  ```

- **Using `rm -r`**: Recursively removes a directory and its contents.

  ```bash
  rm -r mydirectory
  ```

## File Types and Extensions

In Linux, file types are determined by their content and not just their extension. Common file types include:

- **Regular Files**: Contain data or code (`.txt`, `.sh`, `.jpg`).
- **Executable Files**: Can be run as programs (`.sh`, `.bin`, `.exe`).
- **Symbolic Links**: Pointers to other files or directories.
- **Directories**: Containers for files and other directories.

You can use the `file` command to determine the type of a file:

```bash
file filename
```

## File Permissions and Ownership

Every file and directory in Linux has associated permissions and ownership that control access:

- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: The group that owns the file.
- **Others**: All other users.

### File Permissions

Permissions are represented as a string of 10 characters (e.g., `-rwxr-xr--`):

- The first character indicates the file type (`-` for a regular file, `d` for a directory).
- The next three characters represent the owner's permissions (`r` for read, `w` for write, `x` for execute).
- The following three represent group permissions.
- The last three represent others' permissions.

### Changing Permissions

- **Using `chmod`**: Modifies file permissions.

  ```bash
  chmod 755 filename.txt
  ```

- **Using `chown`**: Changes file ownership.

  ```bash
  chown user:group filename.txt
  ```

## Special Directories

### Home Directory

The home directory (`~`) is where user files and personal settings are stored. Each user has a unique home directory located under `/home/username`.

### Root Directory

The root directory (`/`) is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy. It contains all other directories and files.
