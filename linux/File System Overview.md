# File System Overview

The Linux file system is a hierarchical structure that organizes and stores all the data on a Linux system. Understanding the file system's layout and components is crucial for effectively managing files and navigating the system.

## The Hierarchical Structure

The Linux file system is organized in a tree-like structure, with the root directory (`/`) at the top. All files and directories branch off from the root, forming a unified directory tree. This structure provides a consistent and organized way to manage files, regardless of their physical location on the storage devices.

### Root Directory (`/`)

The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system. All other directories and files reside under this directory. It serves as the starting point for navigating the entire file system.
